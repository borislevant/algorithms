"How do I learn about data structures and algorithms from scratch?"

Believe it or not, this is still the dominant question I get from new connections on LinkedIn. First, I'd like to mention that I was never a competitive programmer and I am not some kind of omniscient guru in this area. I can, however, provide some advice for folks.

1. Pick up a copy of Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick.
2. Start reading this book. When you get to the first algorithm or data structure, read it through. Really try to understand everything you're reading. Sometimes this means reading the chapter several times.
3. Once you think you've gotten a handle on the concept, go over to YouTube and watch some NeetCode videos in the same subject area. Learn to imitate the process, not the solution. This content creator is masterful at deconstructing and explaining the problem solving process.
4. Go to LeetCode.com. Select the tag for the area you've just studied, select easy, and sort by acceptance rate. This will give you the easiest on-ramp to problem solving in this area. Solve as many problems as you can until you're bored by the level of difficulty.
5. Move on to medium problems in this same area. Sort by acceptance rate. Repeat.
6. Move on to the next concept in the book and repeat the previous steps.

If you're like me, at a certain point you'll want to know exactly why these algorithms work as they do and perform as they do. If you have this itch, that's a good sign. You can scratch it by picking up Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS. This book will provide you the tools for understand the algorithms and data structures more deeply by providing proofs and asymptotic analysis unparalleled to most literature in the area. You can repeat the previous steps with this book in areas you want to strengthen.

If the math in this previous title gives you trouble, pick up Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Rosen. You won't have to finish this, but if you work through the first few chapters it should allow you to develop enough mathematical maturity to get through Introduction to Algorithms.
